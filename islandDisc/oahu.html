          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Daniel K. Inouye International Airport (HNL) on O‘ahu is Hawai‘i’s major airport, serving as the entry point for most of Hawai‘i’s visitors. All major domestic carriers and many international carriers serve O‘ahu, making it accessible from just about anywhere.
          <br><br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You can get around by car rental, shuttle, taxi, or O‘ahu’s public transportation system (TheBus). Note: Rental cars are in high demand, so plan to secure a reservation. More information about vehicle rental and ground transportation options can be found here. Many visitors also enjoy taking bus tours to conveniently explore the island. Others rent mopeds and motorcycles. However, to experience all that O‘ahu offers, consider reserving a rental car in advance from Daniel K. Inouye International Airport. 
          <br><br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;O‘ahu’s city transportation system is aptly named “TheBus.” Fares are reasonable, routes are extensive, and there are special visitor passes for multiple-day use. Note: You will need cash or a Holo card to ride! For more information on fares, bus routes to popular attractions, and other useful information, visit <a href="http://www.thebus.org" target="_blank">here</a>.

          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you are looking for Waikīkī transportation and an effortless way to visit nearby attractions, the trolley is an affordable option. The routes and destinations are not as extensive as TheBus, but the trolley goes to most major visitor attractions and offers tickets for unlimited rides over a certain number of days.

          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Taxis are a great way to travel when in a group, and the cost can be shared. You can find taxi stands at most major shopping centers, in the business district, and at the airport. Note that, rather than hailing a cab, finding taxi stands at major shopping centers and businesses, as well as calling for pickups via hotel concierge or phone, is the norm in Hawai‘i.
